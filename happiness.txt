- Wed Mar 02 15:34:57 CET 2016  ---  7  ---  Really tired upon embracing regexes. Yet, new challenge ahead!
- Wed Mar 02 16:36:32 CET 2016  ---  10  ---  Favorite food fixed by Justyna!
- Thu Mar 03 12:34:27 CET 2016  ---  8  ---  Fulfilling my goals like a machine. I'm having difficult time focusing right now though. I guess I'm not carved for spending 8 hours in the office. I'm going to try mindfulness meditation if I won't get focused in 10.
- Thu Mar 03 13:17:24 CET 2016  ---  8  ---  Regex problem solved, not fully though.
- Thu Mar 03 13:43:01 CET 2016  ---  9  ---  My app is starting to work and be useful
- Thu Mar 03 15:28:12 CET 2016  ---  6  ---  Stress levels increased gradually for no apparent reason, had 15 minutes of a variant of mindfulness meditation which was great. Then had a cauliflower soup bought downstairs. I don't like soups. But there were cashews in it. And then I had a banana that tasted like grapefruit. I'm a bit blah.
- Thu Mar 03 15:50:11 CET 2016  ---  6  ---  Definitely bad food
- Fri Mar 04 13:17:03 CET 2016  ---  9  ---  After initial turbulences caused by poor sleep (ethereum fever), the breakfast was great, I've learned a great deal already, and I've translated my parser to parse ether data. Software engineering is great.
- Fri Mar 04 15:35:19 CET 2016  ---  8  ---  Stable progress in building my programming skills. A bit tired, probably my choline levels are getting depleted.
- Fri Mar 04 17:23:03 CET 2016  ---  9  ---  Progress on all of my apps and overall git handiness
- Mon Mar 07 13:06:38 CET 2016  ---  8  ---  Play doh worked as a reward experiment. It's pretty fun, though my general happiness level is so-so today.
- Tue Mar 08 15:03:39 CET 2016  ---  8  ---  I have a better day than yestarday, though I'm a bit directionless. Can't figure out my next concrete goal to pursue.
- Wed Mar 09 10:51:57 CET 2016  ---  9  ---  Useful feedback from Tomek Solak. Confirmation that I'm choosing the right path, with a remark that I should consider dropping Java as soon as I reach my main goal for H1 2016
- Wed Mar 09 11:40:29 CET 2016  ---  10  ---  Supermotivated, superfocused. Playing around with fascinating technology
- Wed Mar 09 15:46:10 CET 2016  ---  10  ---  Done something impossible in java (after meditating 5 minutes). Prior to that, I rewarded myself with Gyokuro Yame Premium.
- Wed Mar 09 17:30:56 CET 2016  ---  10  ---  Just made it to the end with data retriever for happymeter. Wow.
