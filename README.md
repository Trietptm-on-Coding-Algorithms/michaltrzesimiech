# Oh hi!
These are just excercise files for my toy projects:

- **cryptocalc**: .JSON fueled Bitcoin/Ethereum portfolio gimmick
- **happymeter**: happiness measurement gimmick (inspired by Nick Winter's ["Motivation Hacker"])
- **exper7**: a very basic expert system (not yet ready)

If by any chance you'll find my code useful for your own projects, go on and use it without asking me. It's great that way.

I'm on my way to become a programmer working full time on a useful project* until June 2016 (I calibrate towards blockchain development and ethereum, would you convince me otherwise?). You can look up whether I try hard enough with this [Beeminder] chart, and then see if my code is any better than a random stuff a drugged chimp typed (it's not drammaticly better yet).

I'm 29, and I owe the decision to my friends in [EA]. I want to be both more useful and subjectively happier (though I'm already in the higher end of my scale).

*By useful project I mean: during one year of running it, A) helps at least one person that is not me either survive or improve life by decreasing suffering (any kind) by at least 10%, and/or increasing others' capacity to reduce at least 10% of suffering of at least one person that is not me by at least 5%, and/or B) enables systemic change that can be predicted with least 60:40 certainty to have positive impact on reducing suffering of at least 100 sentient beings and/or mitigating existential risk (both by at least 5%), and/or C) gets me closer to or better at A) and/or B) in a way I can argument for in front of at least 2 of my neutral friends.
