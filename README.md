# Oh hi!
These are just excercise files for my toy projects:

- **cryptocalc**: .JSON fueled Bitcoin/Ethereum portfolio gimmick
- **happymeter**: happiness measurement gimmick (inspired by Nick Winter's ["Motivation Hacker"])
- **exper7**: a very basic expert system (not yet ready)

My sole focus is to spend 222 hours coding Java and 61 hours learning its concepts to start full time work doing programming on an urgent* project by the end of June 2016.

You can look up whether I learn hard enough with this [Beeminder] chart, and then see if head into the right direction in [here].

*Ideal characteristics of an urgent project are: during 1 year of running it, the odds are at least 60:40 in favor of A) causing at least 1 person that is not me either to avoid early death (age <20) or suffer less by at least 10% (on a subjective scale; if a result of illness, poverty, and/or abuse of power); B) increasing capacity of others to save life (as described) or reduce suffering (as described) of at least one person that is not me by at least 10%; C) getting me closer to A) and/or B) in a way I can argument for in front of at least 2 of my neutral friends.

If by any chance you'll find my code useful for your own projects, go on and use it without asking me. It's great that way.
