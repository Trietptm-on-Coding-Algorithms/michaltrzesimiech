# Hi!
These are just excercise files for my toy projects:

- **exper7**: a basic expert system written in Java (in progress)
- **cryptocalc**: Bitcoin and Ethereum calculator written in Java (fed by Selenium or JSON) (in progress)
- **happymeter**: happiness measurement gimmick written in Java (inspired by Nick Winter's ["Motivation Hacker"])
- **solidity-contracts**: here's where I store my first steps in [Solidity]

My sole focus is to spend 222 hours on coding and 61 hours on learning concepts in order to start full time work on blockchain development until June 2016 (with 1 month buffer). You can look up whether I work hard enough with this [Beeminder] chart, and then see if my code is any good so far. Is there anything I'm missing here? Just send me a word: michal@efektywnyaltruizmkrakow.org

If by any chance you'll find my code useful for your own projects, go on and use it without asking me. It's great that way.

I have made my decision based on 12 months of ignoring advice offered to me by my friends in [EA] and [CFAR]. I have also made an oath not to change this direction for 2 years unless I fail, or if the odds of having positive impact* will fall below 60:40, based on oppinion of at least 2 trusted experts (one of whom is my future employer).

*By positive Impact I mean that the odds are at least 60:40 in favor of A) causing at least 1 person that is not me either to avoid early death (age <20) or suffer less by at least 10% (on a subjective scale; if a result of illness, poverty, and/or abuse of power); B) increasing capacity of others to save life (as described) or reduce suffering (as described) of at least one person that is not me by at least 10%; C) getting me closer to A) and/or B) in a way I can argument for in front of at least 2 of my neutral friends.
