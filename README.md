# Oh hi!
These are just excercise files for my toy projects:

- **cryptocalc**: .JSON fueled Bitcoin/Ethereum portfolio gimmick
- **happymeter**: happiness measurement gimmick (inspired by Nick Winter's ["Motivation Hacker"])

I learn Python and Java to become a full time developer in June 2016. I  do this intensively since January 2016, and yeah I know the goal's ambitious. I'm going to do it nevertheless until it's June and I'm either dead or doing important stuff with Ethereum/blockchain.

You can check if I try hard enough since I measure effort I put in on [Beeminder]. If you're interested in helping me out (code review, maybe?), why don't you drop me an email at michal@efektywnyaltruizmkrakow.org.

If, by any chance, you'll find my code useful for your own projects, go on and use it without asking me. It's great that way.
