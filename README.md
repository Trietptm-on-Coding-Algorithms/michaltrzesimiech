# Hi!
These are just excercise files for my toy projects:

- **cryptocalc**: .JSON fueled Bitcoin/Ethereum portfolio gimmick written in Java
- **happymeter**: happiness measurement gimmick written in Java (inspired by Nick Winter's ["Motivation Hacker"])
- **exper7**: a very basic expert system written in Java (not yet ready)

My sole focus is to spend 222 hours on coding and 60 hours on learning concepts in order to start full time work on blockchain development until June 2016. You can look up whether I work hard enough with this [Beeminder] chart, and then see if my code is any good so far.

I have made my decision based on 12 months of ignoring advice offered to me by my friends in [EA] and [CFAR].

Is there anything I'm missing here? Just [send] me a sentence.

If by any chance you'll find my code useful for your own projects, go on and use it without asking me. It's great that way.
