# Oh hi!
These are just excercise files for my toy projects:

- **cryptocalc**: .JSON fueled Bitcoin/Ethereum portfolio gimmick
- **happymeter**: happiness measurement gimmick (inspired by Nick Winter's ["Motivation Hacker"])
- **exper7**: a very basic expert system (not yet ready)

I'm 29, and thanks to my friends in [EA], I've made the decision to get both more useful and fulfilled. My sole focus is to spend 222 hours coding Java and 61 hours learning its concepts to get to working full time doing programming on 1 urgent project* and 1 gamble project** by the end of June 2016. 

You can look up whether I learn hard enough with this [Beeminder] chart, and then [see] if my code is any better than the stuff a drugged chimp typed (hey, how can I make it better?).

*By seriously urgent project I mean: during 1 year of running it, it A) causes at least 1 person that is not me either to avoid early death (age <20) or suffer less by at least 10% (on a subjective scale), if one or the other is a result of illness, poverty, and/or abuse of power; and/or increasing capacity of others to save life (age <20) or reduce suffering (as described) of at least one person that is not me by at least 5%; and/or B) contributes to an uncrowded field or entreprise that can be predicted to have at least 60:40 chance to reduce (or prevent) early death and/or suffering (as described) of at least 1000 persons (10000 within a decade, if not possible within a single year); or C) gets me closer to A) and/or B) in a way I can argument for in front of at least 2 of my neutral friends.

**By gamble project I mean any project we both think I could be useful at. This is in case the world is prevalently chaotic and setting concrete goals doesn't make >5% sense.

If by any chance you'll find my code useful for your own projects, go on and use it without asking me. It's great that way.
